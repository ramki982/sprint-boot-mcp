Okay, creating a Java Spring Boot starter to make a REST API application MCP-compatible, similar to how `fastapi_mcp` works for FastAPI, is definitely feasible. It's a great idea to bring MCP capabilities to the Spring ecosystem.

Here’s a breakdown of the concepts and steps involved:

**1. Understanding the Goal & MCP**

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** As the search results indicate, MCP is an open standard protocol designed for AI applications (like chatbots or IDE extensions, often called "clients" or "hosts") to interact securely and consistently with external data sources or functionalities (called "servers").
* **MCP Primitives:** Key concepts are **Tools** (actions the AI can invoke, like calling an API endpoint) and **Resources** (data the AI can request, like fetching a file or database record). There are also Prompts, Notifications, etc.
* **`fastapi_mcp` Role:** This library likely inspects an existing FastAPI application and automatically exposes its REST API endpoints as MCP **Tools**.
* **Your Goal:** Create a Spring Boot starter (`spring-boot-starter-mcp`) that does the same for Spring Boot REST controllers – automatically exposing `@RestController` endpoints as MCP Tools.

**2. Key Components of Your Spring Boot Starter**

You'll need to create a standard Spring Boot auto-configuration project. Here are the essential parts:

* **Java MCP SDK/Library:** You'll need a Java library that handles the underlying MCP communication (JSON-RPC over STDIO or HTTP/SSE). Search results suggest SDKs exist or are emerging. You might need to find an official one from Anthropic or a community implementation, or potentially implement parts of the protocol yourself if a suitable library isn't available. This is a crucial dependency.
* **Auto-Configuration Class (`McpAutoConfiguration.java`):**
    * Annotated with `@AutoConfiguration`.
    * Uses conditional annotations (`@ConditionalOnWebApplication`, `@ConditionalOnClass` for the MCP SDK, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`) to activate only when appropriate.
    * Defines `@Bean`s for the necessary components (like the MCP Endpoint Controller and the Introspection Service).
    * Loads configuration properties using `@EnableConfigurationProperties(McpProperties.class)`.
* **Configuration Properties Class (`McpProperties.java`):**
    * Annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mcp.server")`.
    * Defines configurable properties like `enabled`, `path` (e.g., `/mcp`), `name`, filtering rules (e.g., `include-paths`, `exclude-annotations`), schema detail level, etc.
* **Spring Endpoint Introspection Service:**
    * A bean that gets injected with the Spring `ApplicationContext`.
    * On startup, it scans the context for beans annotated with `@RestController`.
    * It iterates through methods annotated with `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, etc.
    * It extracts metadata: HTTP method, path, parameters (`@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestBody`), return types, and potentially documentation from annotations like OpenAPI's `@Operation`.
    * This service translates this REST endpoint information into MCP **Tool** definitions (name, description, parameters, response format) and registers them with the underlying MCP Server logic (from the SDK).
* **MCP Endpoint Controller (`McpEndpointController.java`):**
    * A `@RestController` mapped to the configured MCP path (e.g., `/mcp`).
    * This controller's primary job is to handle the MCP protocol communication (likely establishing an SSE connection if using HTTP). It will receive MCP messages, delegate them to the core MCP server logic/SDK for processing (like tool discovery or execution requests), and send back responses over the connection. Spring WebFlux might be suitable here if using reactive SSE.
* **Tool Execution Handler/Dispatcher:**
    * When the MCP Server logic receives a request to execute a specific tool (which corresponds to one of your REST endpoints), this component needs to:
        * Identify the target Spring controller bean and method.
        * Map the incoming MCP parameters to the Java method arguments (potentially involving JSON deserialization for `@RequestBody`).
        * Invoke the target controller method (e.g., using reflection or Spring's handler mapping infrastructure).
        * Translate the Java method's return value (handling `ResponseEntity` if used) into the appropriate MCP tool execution response format.
* **Auto-Configuration Registration:** Create the file `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports` and list your `McpAutoConfiguration` class in it.

**3. Implementation Steps Outline:**

1.  **Setup Project:** Create a new Maven or Gradle project for your starter (`mcp-spring-boot-starter`). Add dependencies: `spring-boot-starter`, `spring-boot-autoconfigure`, `spring-web` (or `spring-webflux` if using reactive SSE), and the chosen Java MCP SDK.
2.  **Define Properties:** Create the `McpProperties` class.
3.  **Implement Introspection:** Create the service to scan for `@RestController` endpoints and translate them into MCP Tool definitions. This is complex and requires understanding Spring's internal request mapping details or using reflection carefully.
4.  **Implement MCP Server Logic:** Integrate the Java MCP SDK. Configure it using `McpProperties` and register the discovered tools from the introspection service.
5.  **Implement Endpoint Controller:** Create the Spring controller to handle the actual MCP communication (e.g., SSE endpoint) and delegate to the MCP Server logic.
6.  **Implement Auto-Configuration:** Create the `McpAutoConfiguration` class to wire everything together conditionally.
7.  **Register Auto-Configuration:** Create the `AutoConfiguration.imports` file.
8.  **Document:** Provide a clear README explaining how users can add your starter as a dependency and configure it via `application.properties`/`yml`.

**Challenges & Considerations:**

* **Java MCP SDK:** The availability and maturity of a Java MCP SDK is critical.
* **Mapping Complexity:** Translating the variety of Spring mapping annotations, parameter types, return types (`ResponseEntity`, DTOs, primitives), and potential use of filters/interceptors/AOP into clean MCP tool definitions is non-trivial.
* **Error Handling:** How should exceptions from your REST controllers be reported back via MCP?
* **Security:** How will MCP calls be authenticated and authorized within the Spring Security context? Your starter might need extension points for security integration.
* **OpenAPI/Swagger:** Leveraging existing OpenAPI annotations (`@Operation`, `@Parameter`, `@ApiResponse`) could significantly improve the descriptions of the generated MCP tools.

This is a substantial but achievable project. Starting with support for basic GET/POST endpoints with simple request/response bodies would be a good first step. Good luck!
